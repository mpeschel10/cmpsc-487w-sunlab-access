Done:
nginx
html
    web page administrator

Next:
php
    configure nginx per https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Nginx#PHP_implementation
    endpoint for add event client
sql
    make access, user tables
endpoint for administrator search
    probably format sql stuff as json

Later:
administrator web page can search
administrator app can do users etc.
sql job to delete old records
authentication someh
separate login page

Mabye:
local client for the card swipe thingy
systemd timer to delete old records

functional requirements:
    records older than 5 years must be deleted in a timely manner (probably once per day)
    searchable history of sunlab access.
        search by date, student id, and time range.
        must have GUI.
    must support multiple types of users.
    admin type users must be able to activate, suspend, and reactivate accounts by ID

non-functional requirements:
    use php, mysql/mariadb on centos on digital ocean for backend
    host on local network to begin with
    host on mpeschel10.com for final demo
    
    two tables: access and users
    access has attributes ID, in/out, timestamp
    users has attributes ID, name, user_type, is_active
    
    one of those SQL functions to delete all records older than 5 years
    script on systemd timer that deletes records older than 5 years
    
    test script to insert a bunch of junk historical records


    html/css/js page for administrator front-end. No framework for now.
    probably python on systemd timer for card reader front-end? Not necessary until 

Assumptions:
    two separate clients:
        one to read from card swipe and send data to https endpoint
        one to read and display history of thing from web server
