Done:
nginx
html
    web page administrator

Next:
php
    endpoint for add event client
        I guess make a file when we receive a put request somehow? PHP can do  that, I hope.
generic request web page that can do get and put requests on demand, for test purposes.
sql
    make access, user tables
        script for cleaning what we've done (deleting tables mostly)
        script for creating the tables
        script for creating a few test records
hook php "event happened" endpoint up to sql
    add php params/whatever for user ID and local timestamp
php endpoint for administrator search
    probably format sql stuff as json
php endpoint for administrator updates

Later:
administrator web page can search
administrator app can do users etc.
sql job to delete old records
authentication someh
separate login page

Maybe:
local client for the card swipe thingy
systemd timer to delete old records
sanity checking for "local time" of swipe records if reported time is like, actually close to server time or if we're getting 3-month old spoofed records or what

Server notes:
pacman -S nginx
systemctl start nginx
# Edit /etc/nginx.conf location block to point to this dir/the other thing
nginx -t
nginx -s
pacman -S php-fpm
systemctl start php-fpm.service
# Edit /etc/nginx.conf location block to fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php-fpm/php-fpm.sock;

functional requirements:
    records older than 5 years must be deleted in a timely manner (probably once per day)
    searchable history of sunlab access.
        search by date, student id, and time range.
        must have GUI.
    must support multiple types of users.
    admin type users must be able to activate, suspend, and reactivate accounts by ID

non-functional requirements:
    use php, mysql/mariadb on centos on digital ocean for backend
    host on local network to begin with
    host on mpeschel10.com for final demo
    
    two tables: access and users
    access has attributes ID, in/out, timestamp
    users has attributes ID, name, user_type, is_active
    
    one of those SQL functions to delete all records older than 5 years
    script on systemd timer that deletes records older than 5 years
    
    test script to insert a bunch of junk historical records


    html/css/js page for administrator front-end. No framework for now.
    probably python on systemd timer for card reader front-end? Not necessary until 

Assumptions:
    two separate clients:
        one to read from card swipe and send data to https endpoint
        one to read and display history of thing from web server
